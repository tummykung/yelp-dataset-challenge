\title{Function to create prediction objects}
\description{Every classifier evaluation using ROCR starts with
  creating a \code{prediction} object. This function is used to
  transform the input data (which can be in vector, matrix, data frame, or
  list form) into a standardized format.}

\usage{
ROCR.prediction(predictions, labels, label.ordering = NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{predictions}{A vector, matrix, list, or data frame containing
    the predictions.}
  \item{labels}{A vector, matrix, list, or data frame containing the
    true class labels. Must have the same dimensions as 'predictions'.}
  \item{label.ordering}{The default
    ordering (cf.details)  of the classes can be changed by supplying a vector
    containing the negative and the positive class label.}
  }

\details{'predictions' and 'labels' can simply be vectors of the same
  length. However, in the case of cross-validation data, different
  cross-validation runs can be provided as the *columns* of a matrix or
  data frame, or as the entries of a list. In the case of a matrix or
  data frame, all cross-validation runs must have the same length, whereas
  in the case of a list, the lengths can vary across the cross-validation
  runs. Internally, as described in section 'Value', all of these input
  formats are converted to list representation.
  
  Since scoring classifiers give relative tendencies towards a negative
  (low scores) or positive (high scores) class, it has to be declared
  which class label denotes the negative, and which the positive class.
  Ideally, labels should be supplied as ordered factor(s), the lower
  level corresponding to the negative class, the upper level to the
  positive class. If the labels are factors (unordered), numeric,
  logical or characters, ordering of the labels is inferred from
  R's built-in \code{<} relation (e.g. 0 < 1, -1 < 1, 'a' < 'b',
  FALSE < TRUE). Use \code{label.ordering} to override this default
  ordering. Please note that the ordering can be locale-dependent
  e.g. for character labels '-1' and '1'.
  
  Currently, ROCR supports only binary classification (extensions toward
  multiclass classification are scheduled for the next release,
  however). If there are more than two distinct label symbols, execution
  stops with an error message. If all predictions use the same two
  symbols that are used for the labels, categorical predictions are
  assumed. If there are more than two predicted values, but all numeric,
  continuous predictions are assumed (i.e. a scoring
  classifier). Otherwise, if more than two symbols occur in the
  predictions, and not all of them are numeric, execution stops with an
  error message.}
